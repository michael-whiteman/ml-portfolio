## Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | Task Type |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| [3D Print Insight](https://github.com/michael-whiteman/3d-print-insight) | July 2025 | Python, Pandas, NumPy, CuPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn | <p align="justify">This project delivers an end-to-end predictive framework for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D-printed part roughness, tension strength, and elongation using a **hill climbing ensemble** that outperforms any single model. By predicting performance before printing, we can be equipped with "what-if" insights before a single print runs. Inverting those models then enables automatic selection of settings to hit target performance, cutting down on trial-and-error, material waste, and overall time-to-market.</p> | Regression |
