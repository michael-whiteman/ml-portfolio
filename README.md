## Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | Task Type |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|---|
| [3D Print Insight](https://github.com/michael-whiteman/3d-print-insight) | July 2025 | Python, Pandas, NumPy, CuPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn | <p align="justify">This project delivers an end-to-end predictive framework for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D-printed part roughness, tension strength, and elongation using a **hill climbing ensemble** that outperforms any single model. By predicting performance before printing, we can be equipped with "what-if" insights before a single print runs. Inverting those models then enables automatic selection of settings to hit target performance, cutting down on trial-and-error, material waste, and overall time-to-market.</p> | Regression |
| [College Income Predictor](https://github.com/michael-whiteman/college-income-predictor) | August 2025 | Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib | <p align="justify">This project delivers a predictive model to estimate whether a college-major combination leads to post-graduation earnings above a target threshold, using College Scorecard data. By applying **feature engineering techniques** (e.g., target encoding, frequency encoding, and imputation) and training a **Random Forest classifier**, it identifies school-major-degree combinations likely to meet a financial goal (e.g., earning more than $50,000 within 1 year of graduation), supporting data-driven college planning.</p> | Classification |
