# Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | Task Type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [3D Print Insight](https://github.com/michael-whiteman/3d-print-insight/tree/main) | July 2025 | Python | This project delivers an end-to-end predictive framework for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D-printed part roughness, tension strength, and elongation using a hill climbing ensemble. By tuning convex weights on out-of-fold predictions, the ensemble outperforms any single model. This demonstrates a practical approach for blending diverse learners to minimize error. | Regression |

Task types: regression, classification, and clustering & dimensionality reduction.
